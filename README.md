# SwiftAlgorithmsAsAPackage

This package wraps up the demo code for my [NSLondon Swift Algorithms talk](https://www.meetup.com/NSLondon/events/277356806/).

Please bear in mind that the code has been designed to illustrate the application of Swift Algorithms specific to pure algorithmic questions. Algorithms is a vast topic so I have focused here on pain points I encountered when solving problems, and trying to apply the package. The talk is NOT an overview of all the package functions, but I included examples I liked with applications to everyday iOS dev.

**NOTE:** The talk was remote, and recorded on Zoom. I have been told that this recording will be made public soon on YouTube (as of 15/04/21).
